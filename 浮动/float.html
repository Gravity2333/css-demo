    <p>The Art Sauna, built next to Serlachius Museum Gösta, integrates Finnish sauna culture into an experience of art,
        nature and architecture. The Art Sauna has been designed by the internationally renowned award-winning trio of
        architects Héctor Mendoza, Mara Partida and Boris Bežan, who also designed the Serlachius Museums’ timber-frame
        extension, the Pavilion, which opened in 2014.

        According to the Finlandia Prize for Architecture presentation, the concrete-structure sauna does not defy
        Finnish sauna architecture. Instead, the Art Sauna transports visitors, accustomed to the archaic, rugged
        Finnish log sauna culture, to a completely unexpected sauna world.

        “The end result is an experiential sauna path, drawing on the cultural backgrounds of its creators, along which
        a substantial amount of art has been placed. The path ends in the steam room via an outdoor space. The Art Sauna
        is unmistakably related to a new sauna culture, where instead of traditional relaxation and washing, people seek
        experiences and a sense of social togetherness,” the presentation states.

        In addition to the Art Sauna, the renovation of the University of Jyväskylä Library and the Jätkäsaari School in
        Helsinki are competing for the Finlandia Prize. The Finlandia Prize for Architecture shortlist is selected by a
        pre-selection jury appointed each year by the Finnish Association of Architects (SAFA). The pre-selection jury
        is chaired by Professor Lehtovuori, according to whom the factors uniting the buildings are education and
        culture as well as high-quality design and realisation.

        “The three selected architectural, landscape and urban sites remind us, on the one hand, of the importance of
        top-quality science, education and learning environments and, on the other hand, highlight how architecture
        creates warm places for good living in an abstracted world.”

        This year, SAFA is awarding the Finlandia Prize for Architecture for the ninth time. The final selection is
        traditionally made by one person, representing a field other than architecture.</p>
