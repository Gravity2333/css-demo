    <p style="border: 1px solid black"> She hopes her son will follow in the footsteps of Ghanaian artist Amaoko Boafo.
        "He has been able to put Ghana on the map when it comes to art," she said.
        But when it comes to international artists, she wants her son to look up to American artist Jackson Pollock and
        the UK's Damian Hirst.
        "Jackson Pollock allowed his inner child to still be with him, even when he was old. His work is vibrant and
        spontaneous and that is how I see my son's work," she said.
        Ms Eghan hopes to get Ace-Liam an international scholarship to continue to grow his artistic talent.
        "I want to encourage parents to nurture the talent in their kids from an early age," she said.
        For now Ace-Liam has his own studio, made for him by his devoted mother, ready to create his next masterpiece.
